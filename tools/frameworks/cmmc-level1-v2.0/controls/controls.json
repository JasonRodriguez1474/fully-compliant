Access enforcement mechanisms can be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security. Other systems include systems internal and external to the organization. This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The definition of and enforcement of access authorizations, other than those determined by account type (e.g., privileged verses [sic] non-privileged) are addressed in requirement 3.1.2 (AC.L1-3.1.2). Identify users, processes, and devices that are allowed to use company computers and can log on to the company network. Automated updates and other automatic processes should be associated with the user who initiated (authorized) the process.

        "discussion": "External systems are systems or components of systems for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements and controls or the determination of the effectiveness of implemented controls on those systems. External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices and privately-owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities. This requirement also addresses the use of external systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of FCI, including accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational systems. Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum, the types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems. This requirement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using external systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational systems. In those situations, organizations need confidence that the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification that the required controls have been effectively implemented can be achieved by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the assurance or confidence level required by organizations. Note that while \"external\" typically refers to outside of the organization's direct supervision and authority, that is not always the case. Regarding the protection of FCI across an organization, the organization may have systems that process FCI and others that do not. And among the systems that process FCI there are likely access restrictions for FCI that apply between systems. Therefore, from the perspective of a given system, other systems within the organization may be considered \"external\" to that system. Control and manage connections between your company network and outside networks. Outside networks could include the public internet, one of your own company's networks that falls outside of your CMMC Assessment Scope (e.g., an isolated lab), or a network that does not belong to your company. Tools to accomplish include firewalls and connection allow/deny lists. External systems not controlled by your company could be running applications that are prohibited or blocked.

Initial authenticator content is the actual content of the authenticator, for example, the initial password. In contrast, the requirements about authenticator content include the minimum password length. Developers ship system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk. Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including minimum password length, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include certificates and passwords. NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities. Before you let a person or a device have access to your system, verify that the user or device is who or what it claims to be. This verification is called authentication. The most common way to verify identity is using a username and a hard-to-guess password. Some devices ship with default usernames and passwords. For example, some devices ship so that when you first log on to the device, the username is \"admin\" and the password is \"admin\". When you have devices with this type of default username and password, immediately change the default password to a unique password you create.

Make sure you have a record of who accesses your facility (e.g., office, plant, factory). You can do this in writing by having employees and visitors sign in and sign out or by electronic means such as badge readers. Whatever means you use, you need to retain the access records for the time period that your company has defined.",

        "discussion": "Communications can be monitored, controlled, and protected at boundary components and by restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems. Boundary components include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a system security architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on protected subnetworks). Restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems includes restricting external web communications traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses. Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security requirements associated with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers and may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. NIST SP 800-41 provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. NIST SP 800-125B provides guidance on security for virtualization technologies. Fences, locks, badges, and key cards help keep non-employees out of your physical facilities. Similarly, your company's IT network or system has boundaries that must be protected. Many companies use a web proxy and a firewall. When an employee uses a company computer to go to a website, a web proxy makes the request on the user's behalf, looks at the web request, and decides if it should let the employee go to the website. A firewall controls access from the inside and outside, protecting valuable information and resources stored on the company's network. A firewall stops unwanted traffic on the internet from passing through an outside \"fence\" to the company's networks and information systems. Internal boundaries determine where data can flow, for instance a software development environment may have its own boundary controlling, monitoring, and protecting the data that can leave that boundary. You may want to monitor, control, or protect one part of the company network from another. This can also be accomplished with a firewall and limits the ability of attackers and disgruntled employees from entering sensitive parts of your internal network and causing damage.",

Example: You are setting up the new network and want to keep your company's information and resources safe. You start by sketching out a simple diagram that identifies the external boundary of your network and any internal boundaries that are needed. The first piece of equipment you install is the firewall, a device to separate your internal network from the internet. The firewall also has a feature that allows you to block access to potentially malicious websites, and you configure that service as well. Some of your coworkers complain that they cannot get onto certain websites. You explain that the new network blocks websites that are known for spreading malware. The firewall sends you a daily digest of blocked activity so that you can monitor the system for attack trends.",

Security-relevant updates include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. Organizations can take advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database in remediating flaws discovered in organizational systems. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types of remediation. NIST SP 800-40 provides guidance on patch management technologies. All software and firmware have potential flaws. Many vendors work to remedy those flaws by releasing vulnerability information and updates to their software and firmware. Contractors must have a process to review relevant vendor notifications and updates about problems or weaknesses. After reviewing the information, the contractor must implement a patch management process that allows for software and firmware flaws to be fixed without adversely affecting the system functionality. Contractors must define the time frames within which flaws are identified, reported, and corrected for all systems.
