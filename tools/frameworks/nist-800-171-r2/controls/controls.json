    "discussion": "Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and between systems (versus who can access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include the following: keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet; blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization; restricting requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server; and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content.  Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.  Transferring information between systems representing different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes: prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.",

    "discussion": "An event is any observable occurrence in a system, which includes unlawful or unauthorized system activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is needed as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the environments in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, administrative privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the CUI security requirements. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be balanced with other system needs. For example, organizations may determine that systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance.  Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of event types, the logging necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented or cloud-based architectures.  Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes time stamps, source and destination addresses, user or process identifiers, event descriptions, success or fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the system after the event occurred).  Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records includes full text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users. Organizations consider limiting the additional audit log information to only that information explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs by not including information that could potentially be misleading or could make it more difficult to locate information of interest. Audit logs are reviewed and analyzed as often as needed to provide important information to organizations to facilitate risk-based decision making.

Effective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities including mission/business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive.  As part of user response activities, incident response training is provided by organizations and is linked directly to the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, regular users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident on the system; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle or remediate incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery, and restoration. Incident response training includes user training in the identification/reporting of suspicious activities from external and internal sources. User response activities also includes incident response assistance which may consist of help desk support, assistance groups, and access to forensics services or consumer redress services, when required.

    "discussion": "Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. The vulnerabilities to be scanned are readily updated as new vulnerabilities are discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This process ensures that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools (e.g., static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes: scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms.  To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using products that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated, scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention, and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of system vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).  Security assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive or the system component that is the subject of the scanning may contain highly sensitive information.

    "discussion": "Organizations employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Transferring information between systems in different security domains with different security policies introduces the risk that the transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners or information stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations mandate specific architectural solutions when required to enforce logical or physical separation between systems in different security domains. Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers between connected systems, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security domain or connected system, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and labels. Secure information transfer solutions often include one or more of the following properties: use of cross-domain solutions when traversing security domains, mutual authentication of the sender and recipient (using hardware-based cryptography), encryption of data in transit and at rest, isolation from other domains, and logging of information transfers (e.g., title of file, file size, cryptographic hash of file, sender, recipient, transfer time and Internet Protocol [IP] address, receipt time, and IP address).",

    "discussion": "In situations where static passwords or personal identification numbers (PIN) are used (e.g., certain system components do not support multifactor authentication or complex account management, such as separate system accounts for each user and logging), automated mechanisms (e.g., password managers) can automatically generate, rotate, manage, and store strong and different passwords for users and device accounts. For example, a router might have one administrator account, but an organization typically has multiple network administrators. Therefore, access management and accountability are problematic. A password manager uses techniques such as automated password rotation (in this example, for the router password) to allow a specific user to temporarily gain access to a device by checking out a temporary password and then checking the password back in to end the access. The password manager simultaneously logs these actions. One of the risks in using password managers is that an adversary may target the collection of passwords that the device generates. Therefore, it is important that these passwords are secured. Methods for protecting passwords include the use of multi-factor authentication to the password manager, encryption, or secured hardware (e.g., a hardware security module).

Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning. It is conducted by penetration testing agents and teams with particular skills and experience that include technical expertise in network, operating system, and application-level security. Penetration testing can be used to validate vulnerabilities or determine a system’s penetration resistance to adversaries within specified constraints. Such constraints include time, resources, and skills. Organizations may also supplement penetration testing with red team exercises. Red teams attempt to duplicate the actions of adversaries in carrying out attacks against organizations and provide an in-depth analysis of security-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Organizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted internally or externally on the hardware, software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and technical controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the system, pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on the pretest analysis, and testing designed to determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the specified rules of engagement before the commencement of penetration testing. Organizations correlate the rules of engagement for penetration tests and red teaming exercises (if used) with the tools, techniques, and procedures that they anticipate adversaries may employ.

    "description": "Create diversity in [Assignment: organization-defined system components] to reduce the extent of malicious code propagation.",
    "discussion": "Organizations often use homogenous information technology environments to reduce costs and to simplify administration and use. However, a homogenous environment can also facilitate the work of the APT, as it allows for common mode failures and the propagation of malicious code across identical system components (i.e., hardware, software, and firmware). In these environments, adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) that work on one instantiation of a system component will work equally well on other identical instantiations of the component regardless of how many times such components are replicated or how far away they may be placed in the architecture. Increasing diversity within organizational systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations or compromises of specific technologies. Such diversity protects against common mode failures, including those failures induced by supply chain attacks. Diversity also reduces the likelihood that the TTP adversaries use to compromise one system component will be effective against other system components, thus increasing the adversary’s work factor to successfully complete the planned attacks. A heterogeneous or diverse information technology environment makes the task of propagating malicious code more difficult, as the adversary needs to develop and deploy different TTP for the diverse components. Satisfying this requirement does not mean that organizations need to acquire and manage multiple versions of operating systems, applications, tools, and communication protocols. However, the use of diversity in certain critical, organizationally determined system components can be an effective countermeasure against the APT. In addition, organizations may already be practicing diversity, although not to counter the APT. For example, it is common for organizations to employ diverse anti-virus products at different parts of their infrastructure simply because each vendor may issue updates to new malicious code patterns at different times and frequencies. Similarly, some organizations employ products from one vendor at the server level and products from another vendor at the end-user level. Another example of diversity occurs in products that provide address space layout randomization (ASLR). Such products introduce a form of synthetic diversity by transforming the implementations of common software to produce a variety of instances. Finally, organizations may choose to use multiple virtual private network (VPN) vendors, tunneling one vendor’s VPN within another vendor’s VPN. Smaller organizations may find that achieving diversity in system components is challenging and perhaps not practical. Organizations also consider the vulnerabilities that may be introduced into the system by the employment of diverse system components.

    "discussion": "Cyber-attacks by adversaries are predicated on the assumption of a certain degree of predictability and consistency regarding the attack surface. The attack surface is the set of points on the boundary of a system, a system element, or an environment where an attacker can try to enter, cause an effect on, or extract data from the system, system element, or environment. Changes to the attack surface reduce the predictability of the environment, making it difficult for adversaries to plan and carry out attacks, and can cause the adversaries to make miscalculations that can either impact the overall effectiveness of the attacks or increase the observability of the attackers. Unpredictability can be achieved by making changes in seemingly random times or circumstances (e.g., by randomly shortening the time when the credentials are valid). Randomness introduces increased levels of uncertainty for adversaries regarding the actions that organizations take to defend their systems against attacks. Such actions may impede the ability of adversaries to correctly target system components that support critical or essential organizational missions or business functions. Uncertainty may also cause adversaries to hesitate before initiating attacks or continuing attacks. Techniques involving randomness include performing certain routine actions at different times of day, employing different information technologies, using different suppliers, and rotating the roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel.",

Such actions can impede the adversary’s ability to conduct meaningful reconnaissance of the targeted organization, delay or degrade an adversary’s ability to move laterally through a system or from one system to another system, divert the adversary away from systems or system components containing CUI, and increase observability of the adversary to the defender—revealing the presence of the adversary along with its TTPs. Misdirection can be achieved through deception environments (e.g., deception nets), which provide virtual sandboxes into which malicious code can be diverted and adversary TTP can be safely examined. Tainting involves embedding data or information in an organizational system or system component which the organization desires adversaries to exfiltrate. Tainting allows organizations to determine that information has been exfiltrated or improperly removed from the organization and potentially provides the organization with information regarding the nature of exfiltration or adversary locations. Disinformation can be achieved by making false information intentionally available to adversaries regarding the state of the system or type of organizational defenses. Any disinformation activity is coordinated with the associated federal agency requiring such activity, and should include a plan to limit incidental exposure of the false CUI to authorized users. Disinformation can be employed both tactically (e.g., making available false credentials that the defender can use to track adversary actions) and strategically (e.g., interspersing false CUI with actual CUI, interfering with an adversary’s re-use, reverse engineering and exploitation of legitimate CUI, thus undermining the adversary’s confidence in the value of the exfiltrated information, and subsequently causing them to limit such exfiltration).

    "discussion": "A mix of physical and logical isolation techniques (described below) implemented as part of the system architecture can limit the unauthorized flow of CUI, reduce the system attack surface, constrain the number of system components that must be secure, and impede the movement of an adversary. When implemented with a set of managed interfaces, physical and logical isolation techniques for organizational systems and components can isolate CUI into separate security domains where additional protections can be implemented. Any communications across the managed interfaces (i.e., across security domains), including for management or administrative purposes, constitutes remote access even if the communications remain within the organization. Separating system components with boundary protection mechanisms allows for the increased protection of individual components and more effective control of information flows between those components. This enhanced protection limits the potential harm from and susceptibility to hostile cyber-attacks and errors. The degree of isolation can vary depending on the boundary protection mechanisms selected. Boundary protection mechanisms include routers, gateways, and firewalls separating system components into physically separate networks or subnetworks; virtualization and micro-virtualization techniques; encrypting information flows among system components using distinct encryption keys; cross-domain devices separating subnetworks; and complete physical separation (i.e., air gaps). System architectures include logical isolation, partial physical and logical isolation, or complete physical isolation between subsystems and at system boundaries between resources that store, process, transmit, or protect CUI and other resources. Examples include:•\tLogical isolation: Data tagging, digital rights management (DRM), and data loss prevention (DLP) that tags, monitors, and restricts the flow of CUI; virtual machines or containers that separate CUI and other information on hosts; and virtual local area networks (VLAN) that keep CUI and other information separate on networks.•\tPartial physical and logical isolation: Physically or cryptographically isolated networks, dedicated hardware in data centers, and secure clients that (a) may not directly access resources outside of the domain (i.e., all applications with cross-enclave connectivity execute as remote virtual applications hosted in a demilitarized zone [DMZ] or internal and protected enclave), (b) access via remote virtualized applications or virtual desktop with no file transfer capability other than with dual authorization, or (c) employ dedicated client hardware (e.g., a zero or thin client) or hardware approved for multi-level secure (MLS) usage.\n•\tComplete physical isolation: Dedicated (not shared) client and server hardware; physically isolated, stand-alone enclaves for clients and servers; and (a) logically separate network traffic (e.g., using a VLAN) with end-to-end encryption using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based cryptography or (b) physical isolation from other networks. Isolation techniques are selected based on a risk management perspective that balances the threat, the information being protected, and the cost of the options for protection. Architectural and design decisions are guided and informed by the security requirements and selected solutions. Organizations consider the trustworthiness of the isolation techniques employed (e.g., the logical isolation relies on information technology that could be considered a high value target because of the function being performed), introducing its own set of vulnerabilities.

    "discussion": "Changing processing and storage locations (also referred to as moving target defense) addresses the APT by using techniques such as virtualization, distributed processing, and replication. This enables organizations to relocate system components that support critical missions and business functions. Changing the locations of processing activities or storage sites introduces a degree of uncertainty into the targeting activities of adversaries. Targeting uncertainty increases the work factor of adversaries making compromises or breaches to organizational systems more difficult and time-consuming. It also increases the chances that adversaries may inadvertently disclose aspects of their tradecraft while attempting to locate organizational resources. Other options for employing moving target defense include changing IP addresses, Domain Name System (DNS) names, or network topologies. Moving target defense can also increase the work factor for defenders who have a constantly changing system to defend. Accordingly, organizations update their management and security tools and train personnel to adapt to the additional work factor. Another way of addressing this requirement is by fragmentation. This involves taking information and fragmenting/partitioning it across multiple components (e.g., across a distributed database). Such actions mean that the compromise (unauthorized exfiltration) of any single component of the information data set will not result in the compromise of the entire data. To fully compromise the entire data set, the adversary would have to work harder to try to locate all of the data sets.",

    "discussion": "Verifying the integrity of the organization’s security-critical or essential software is an important capability since corrupted software is the primary attack vector used by adversaries to undermine or disrupt the proper functioning of organizational systems. There are many ways to verify software integrity throughout the system development life cycle. Root of trust mechanisms (e.g., secure boot, trusted platform modules, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface [UEFI]), verify that only trusted code is executed during boot processes. This capability helps system components protect the integrity of boot firmware in organizational systems by verifying the integrity and authenticity of updates to the firmware prior to applying changes to the system component and preventing unauthorized processes from modifying the boot firmware. The employment of cryptographic signatures ensures the integrity and authenticity of critical and essential software that stores, processes, or transmits, CUI. Cryptographic signatures include digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash, and using the public key to verify the hash information. Hardware roots of trust are considered to be more secure. This requirement supports 3.4.1e and 3.4.3.e.[FIPS 140-3] provides security requirements for cryptographic modules.

    "discussion": "Organizations may have a variety of systems and system components in their inventory, including Information Technology (IT), Internet of Things (IoT), Operational Technology (OT), and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The convergence of IT, OT, IoT, and IIoT significantly increases the attack surface of organizations and provides attack vectors that are challenging to address. Compromised IoT, OT, and IIoT system components can serve as launching points for attacks on organizational IT systems that handle CUI. Some IoT, OT, and IIoT system components can store, transmit, or process CUI (e.g., specifications or parameters for objects manufactured in support of critical programs). Most of the current generation of IoT, OT, and IIoT system components are not designed with security as a foundational property and may not be able to be configured to support security functionality. Connections to and from such system components are generally not encrypted, do not provide the necessary authentication, are not monitored, and are not logged. Therefore, these components pose a significant cyber threat. Gaps in IoT, OT, and IIoT security capabilities may be addressed by employing intermediary system components that can provide encryption, authentication, security scanning, and logging capabilities—thus, preventing the components from being accessible from the Internet. However, such mitigation options are not always available or practicable. The situation is further complicated because some of the IoT, OT, and IIoT devices may be needed for essential missions and business functions. In those instances, it is necessary for such devices to be isolated from the Internet to reduce the susceptibility to cyber-attacks.

    "discussion": "This requirement mitigates risk from the APT by reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., the window of opportunity for the attack). By implementing the concept of non-persistence for selected system components, organizations can provide a known state computing resource for a specific time period that does not give adversaries sufficient time to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational systems and the environments in which those systems operate. Since the APT is a high-end, sophisticated threat regarding capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period, a percentage of attacks will be successful. Non-persistent system components and system services are activated as required using protected information and are terminated periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work factor of adversaries attempting to compromise or breach systems.  Non-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components (e.g., periodically reimaging components or using a variety of common virtualization techniques). Non-persistent services can be implemented using “Infrastructure as Code” to automatically build, configure, test, deploy, and manage containers, virtual machines, or new instances of processes on physical machines (both persistent or non-persistent). Periodic refreshes of system components and services do not require organizations to determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that may often be difficult to determine). The refresh of selected system components and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks but not with such frequency that it makes the system unstable. Refreshes may be done periodically to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of vulnerabilities.  The reimaging of system components includes the reinstallation of firmware, operating systems, and applications from a known, trusted source. Reimaging also includes the installation of patches, reapplication of configuration settings, and refresh of system or application data from a known, trusted source.",

Removal is consistent with federal records retention policies and disposition schedules. Retaining information for longer than it is needed makes the information a potential target for adversaries searching for critical program or HVA information to exfiltrate. The unnecessary retention of system-related information provides adversaries information that can assist in their reconnaissance and lateral movement through organizational systems. Alternatively, information which must be retained but is not required for current activities is removed from online storage and stored offline in a secure location to eliminate the possibility of individuals gaining unauthorized access to the information through a network.
